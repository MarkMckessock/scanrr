# scanrr — Design Specification

> **Status:** Draft v0.3 · **Owner:** Mark Mckessock
> This document is the **source of truth** for scanrr's design. Code follows the
> spec; when they disagree, update the spec first. Decisions marked
> **[OPEN]** need a call before the affected code is written.
>
> **v0.2** — folded in the adversarial-review outcomes: validated integrity
> detection (§7), file-stability gate + transient-error retries + lazy
> revalidation (§3), per-file timeouts & real cancellation via `pebble` (§6),
> single-writer DB thread (§5), replacement verify-loop (§9), in-cluster authz
> (§11/§14), and observability (§14a). `#n` tags trace back to review points.
>
> **v0.3** — resolved the five open questions (`Qn` tags): concurrent runs over a
> global path-deduplicated queue (§6), human-approval gate for replacements (§9),
> bounded polling of arr (§9), and a queued/periodically-flushed notification
> pipeline (§10). Schema updated accordingly (§8).
>
> **v0.4 — configuration as code.** Jobs **and** arr instances are now defined in a
> mounted YAML config file (§0), held in memory as the **sole source of truth** —
> read-only in the app. This removes the `jobs`, `arr_instances`, and
> `path_mappings` tables (§8); jobs are referenced by a deterministic **slug** and
> a run snapshots its job definition (self-contained). Arr instances are referenced
> by **name**, carry their own path mappings, and their API keys live in the mounted
> config (a k8s Secret) — so **app-level secret encryption is removed** (§14).

## 0. Configuration as Code (YAML)

scanrr is configured by a single **YAML file** mounted into the container (path from
`SCANRR_CONFIG_FILE`, e.g. a Kubernetes ConfigMap/Secret at `/config/scanrr.yaml`).
It is read **once at startup** and is **read-only** in the app — a pod restart
re-applies changes (the GitOps loop). It is the **sole source of truth** for
settings, jobs, and arr instances; none of these are persisted in the DB.

```yaml
settings:                      # override any RuntimeConfig tunable (§13)
  max_scan_workers: 4
  detector_backend: subprocess

radarr:                        # zero or more Radarr instances
  - name: main                 # globally unique across sonarr+radarr
    url: http://radarr:7878
    api_key: <key>             # secret — put the whole file in a k8s Secret (§14)
    mappings:                  # arr-namespace path → scanrr mount
      - { from: /data/media/movies, to: /mnt/movies }
sonarr:                        # zero or more Sonarr instances (same shape)
  - name: tv
    url: http://sonarr:8989
    api_key: <key>
    mappings: [{ from: /data/media/tv, to: /mnt/tv }]

pushover:                      # optional notifications (§10)
  user_key: <key>
  api_token: <key>
  events: [corrupt_found, scan_completed, replacement_completed]  # omit = all

jobs:
  - name: Movies               # slug = slugify(name), unique; used in routes/runs
    type: path
    root_path: /mnt/movies
    ttl_days: 30
    schedule_cron: "0 3 * * *"
  - name: TV
    type: arr
    arr_instance: tv           # reference an instance by name
    ttl_days: 14
    auto_replace: true         # re-request corrupt files (§9)
    auto_approve: false        # keep the human approval gate (default)
```

- **Jobs** are held in an in-memory registry keyed by `slug` (a deterministic slug
  of the name). A run **snapshots** its job's definition (§8 `job_runs`), so run
  history renders and remains valid even after a job is removed from the YAML.
- **Arr instances** are held in a registry keyed by `name`; each carries its own
  `mappings`. Jobs of `type: arr` reference an instance by name.
- **Precedence:** code `DEFAULTS` → YAML `settings:`. A missing/empty file is a
  no-op (defaults, no jobs/instances).
- The **CLI** `scanrr scan <path>` builds a *transient* in-memory job (not
  persisted) for one-off scans.
- The **UI** shows jobs and instances read-only, plus a "Generate job YAML" helper
  that emits a stanza to paste into the config (§12).

## 1. Overview

**scanrr** periodically scans a media library for **corrupt video files** (bad
frames, broken i-frames, bitstream errors) using ffmpeg, records results in a
durable store, and surfaces failures through a modern web UI. It integrates with
Sonarr/Radarr to discover library paths and to automatically re-request corrupt
files, and it emits notifications via Pushover.

The design centres on **content-addressed idempotency**: a file's integrity is a
deterministic property of its bytes, so results are cached by content hash and
reused across paths, runs, and restarts. A scan that fails partway through never
re-does completed work.

### Goals

- Detect corrupt media reliably via full-file ffmpeg integrity checks.
- Never re-scan unchanged content: skip via (size+mtime) fast-path, per-job TTL,
  and cross-path content-hash dedup.
- Survive crashes/restarts without losing progress or duplicating work.
- Two job types: **path** (absolute directory) and **arr** (Sonarr/Radarr library).
- Optional automatic re-request of corrupt files through Sonarr/Radarr.
- Pushover notifications for key lifecycle events.
- A beautiful, responsive UI for config, live scan progress, and corrupt-file triage.

### Non-Goals (v1)

- Transcoding / remuxing / repair of files (we detect, we don't fix bytes).
- Multi-node distributed workers (single container, internal worker pool).
- Auth/multi-user (deployed behind Cloudflare Zero Trust like the rest of the homelab).
- Media types other than video (audio-only / images out of scope for v1).

## 2. Core Concepts (Domain Model)

| Concept | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Job** | A `path` or `arr` scan target defined in the YAML config (§0): source + TTL + schedule + options. Held in memory (no DB row), referenced by a deterministic **slug**, and **read-only** in the app. |
| **Job Run** | One execution of a Job. **Snapshots** the job definition (slug/name/type/config/ttl/auto_replace) so it stays self-contained if the job is later removed from the YAML. |
| **Scan Task** | One file's work item on the **global, path-deduplicated** queue. Shared across runs (many runs may subscribe); processed once. |
| **Run File** | A run's per-file ledger entry (disposition + outcome) — how each run "sees" the shared work, incl. skips. |
| **File** | A path on disk: its current hash, size, mtime, and last-scan bookkeeping. |
| **Scan Result** | Content-addressed (keyed by hash) ffmpeg verdict: `ok` / `corrupt`. The reusable cache. Transient `error`/`timeout` outcomes are *not* stored here. |
| **Detection** | A corrupt file observed at a path, with remediation state (open → resolved). What the user triages. |
| **Replacement** | An attempt to re-acquire a corrupt file via Sonarr/Radarr. |
| **Arr Instance** | A Sonarr/Radarr endpoint (name + URL + API key + path mappings) defined in the YAML config (§0). Held in memory, referenced by **name**, read-only in the app. |

**Key invariant:** `Scan Result` is keyed by **content hash**, valid only for a
given **detector version + backend**, never by path. `File` maps path → hash.
`Detection` maps a corrupt observation → remediation. This separation is what
makes cross-path dedup and idempotent resume fall out naturally.

**Jobs and arr instances are configuration, not data** — they live only in the
mounted YAML (§0), never in the DB. The DB holds *runtime state* (runs, tasks,
files, results, detections, replacements); a run persists its job as a snapshot so
history survives config changes.

---

## 3. Scan Algorithm & Idempotency (the heart of the system)

Work happens in two phases: **discovery** (per run, cheap, decides each file's
disposition and enqueues only real work) and the **worker** (once per shared
queue task, does the expensive scan and fans the result out to every subscribed run).

All full-file reads (hashing **and** decoding) happen in the **worker pool**, so
they're throttled by `max_scan_workers`. Discovery is deliberately **stat-only** —
it must not read file contents, or a first scan of a large library would read every
file in the discovery loop, unthrottled, competing with the workers for NFS bandwidth.

**Phase A — discovery (per run, stat-only, cheap):**
```
for path in discover(job):
    stat = os.stat(path)

    # 0. Stability gate — never scan a file that may still be written/importing.
    if (now - stat.st_mtime) < min_file_age_seconds:        # default 120s
        record(run, path, "skipped_too_fresh"); continue

    f = files.get(path)

    # 1. TTL fast-path — no disk read. last_scanned_at is GLOBAL (a scan is a scan
    #    regardless of which job did it); TTL is evaluated against it.
    if f and f.size_bytes == stat.st_size and f.mtime == stat.st_mtime
           and f.last_scanned_at and (now - f.last_scanned_at) < job.ttl:
        record(run, path, "skipped_ttl"); continue

    # 2. Enqueue on the shared queue, deduped by path. active_task() is an
    #    optimistic check; the ux_scan_tasks_active_path unique index is the real
    #    guard — on an enqueue race, catch the conflict and subscribe to the winner.
    task = enqueue_or_subscribe(path, run)    # create+subscribe, or subscribe if active
    record(run, path, "queued", task)
```

**Phase B — worker (once per shared task; hash → cache-check → decode → fan-out).**
The dispatcher (§6) claims the next `pending` task by `seq`, marks it `scanning`,
and runs the worker. `fan_out` is the single place every subscribed run is credited,
so `ok`, `corrupt`, and `unreadable` all converge on the same accounting — which is
what guarantees runs always finalize (§6).
```
task = claim_next_pending()                 # by seq; task.status = "scanning"
h = hash_file(task.path); task.content_hash = h            # blake3, one read (#2)

# Content-addressed cache — reuse only if valid for the CURRENT detector (version
# AND backend). A mismatch is a miss (lazy revalidation, below) — decode, don't
# force a library-wide rescan. This is where cross-path / outside-TTL dedup lands.
sr = scan_results.get(h)
if sr and sr.detector_version == DETECTOR_VERSION and sr.detector_backend == DETECTOR_BACKEND:
    result = sr                             # cache hit → skip the expensive decode
else:
    result = ffmpeg_integrity_check(task.path, timeout=max_scan_seconds)   # §7
    if result.status in ("ok", "corrupt"):  # cache deterministic verdicts only
        scan_results.upsert(h, result, DETECTOR_VERSION, DETECTOR_BACKEND)

if result.status in ("ok", "corrupt"):
    files.upsert(task.path, hash=h, size_bytes=stat.st_size, mtime=stat.st_mtime,
                 last_scanned_at=now)
    task.status, task.result_status = "done", result.status
    detection = reconcile_detections(task.path, h, result.status)   # open/resolve
    if result.status == "corrupt":
        enqueue_notification("corrupt_found", path=task.path)       # §10 queue
    fan_out(task, result.status, detection)
else:                                       # error / timeout = TRANSIENT
    retry_or_fail(task)                     # NOT cached; back to 'pending' w/ backoff...
    if task.status == "unreadable":         # ...until scan_max_attempts exhausted
        fan_out(task, "unreadable", detection=None)

def fan_out(task, outcome, detection):      # credit EVERY subscribed run
    for run in subscribers(task):
        set_outcome(run, task.path, outcome)             # run_files.outcome
        if outcome == "corrupt":
            emit_sse(run, "detection.created", detection)
            if run.job.auto_replace:
                propose_replacement(detection, run.job)   # §9 (approval-gated)
        emit_sse(run, "task.updated"); maybe_finalize(run)   # §6 lifecycle step 5
```

`reconcile_detections(path, hash, status)` closes the remediation loop (#6): a
`corrupt` verdict opens (or reuses) the file's detection; an `ok` verdict on a path
that had an **open detection for a different hash** auto-resolves it. It's called
once per task (detections are **global to the file**, not per-run); `detections.job_run_id`
records only the run that *first* surfaced it (informational). Replacement proposal
is **per subscribing job** (subscribers may differ on `auto_replace`). `maybe_finalize`
completes a run once every one of its `run_files` rows has a terminal outcome —
reached for all three outcomes, so no run is left hanging.

**Why this satisfies every requirement:**

- *"Don't re-scan within TTL"* → Phase A steps 0–1 (TTL gates the stat-only fast path).
- *"Skip if hash unchanged"* → step 1 (path unchanged) and the worker cache-check.
- *"Skip if hash already recorded under a different path, even outside TTL"* → the
  worker cache-check skips the decode regardless of TTL (deterministic hash → verdict).
- *"Idempotent if a scan fails"* → `ok`/`corrupt` verdicts are cached by hash; a
  re-run skips the decode. Transient failures retry (below), never poisoning the cache.

Per-run counters on `job_runs` are **derived from `run_files` at finalize** (the
ledger is authoritative; live progress comes from SSE + count queries). Note the
global `files_scanned_total` metric (§14a) counts **actual decodes** — one per task —
so it is *less* than the sum of per-run scanned counts whenever a file is shared by
overlapping runs. That's intended: the metric measures work done, the counters measure
per-run coverage.

**Transient errors & retries (#5, #8):** `error` (couldn't open) and `timeout`
are **not** verdicts — an NFS blip, a lock, or a still-importing file can cause
them, so they are **never content-cached**. The task retries with exponential
backoff up to `scan_max_attempts` (default 3); on exhaustion the task becomes
`unreadable` and is surfaced in the UI as needs-attention — never silently
dropped, and never confused with `corrupt`. The step-0 stability gate prevents
most mid-write false errors up front.

**Detector versioning — lazy revalidation (#7, #11):** cache validity keys on
both `detector_version` (bumped when detection logic/args change) and
`detector_backend`. A mismatch does **not** trigger an immediate library-wide
re-scan (which could be days of NFS I/O). The cached verdict is shown flagged
`stale` — a **computed** flag (its `detector_version`/`detector_backend` ≠ current),
not a stored column. The file is only re-scanned when it's next naturally due (TTL /
content change) or via an explicit, scope-previewed **"Revalidate library"** action.

**Hashing:** whole-file [blake3](https://github.com/oconnor663/blake3-py)
(multithreaded, far faster than sha256; the NFS read dominates on large remuxes).
The (size, mtime) fast-path (step 1) avoids reading the file at all on the common
"nothing changed" case. The extra full read on a cache miss (#2) is an accepted
cost — decided in favour of simple, exact whole-file dedup over a partial
signature. **Decided:** blake3 (multi-core headroom for local/cached scans, no
adversary to need SHA's standardisation); NFS read dominates so the choice is
low-stakes. `hash_algorithm` remains configurable to sha256.

## 4. Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Python 3.12**, **FastAPI** + **Uvicorn** (async orchestrator + REST + SSE).
- **PyAV** (libav bindings, in-process) as the primary integrity checker — honours
  the "prefer bindings over shelling out" preference. **subprocess ffmpeg** kept as
  a configurable fallback (§7).
- **blake3** for content hashing.
- **SQLModel** (SQLAlchemy 2.x core + Pydantic models) over **SQLite** (WAL mode).
- **Alembic** for migrations.
- **APScheduler** for cron-based job scheduling.
- **httpx** for Sonarr/Radarr and Pushover clients.
- **`pebble.ProcessPool`** for the scan workers — chosen over `ProcessPoolExecutor`
  for **per-task timeouts** and real **cancellation** (terminates the worker
  process), which stock futures cannot do (§6).
- **prometheus-client** for the `/metrics` endpoint (§14a).

### Frontend
- **React 18 + TypeScript + Vite**.
- **Tailwind CSS** + **shadcn/ui** (Radix primitives) for a clean, modern look.
- **TanStack Query** for server state; **React Router** for routing.
- **Recharts** for dashboard charts; **lucide-react** icons.
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for live scan/run progress (one-directional, simpler
  than WebSockets and a perfect fit).

### Packaging / Ops
- Single **multi-stage Docker image**: build frontend → serve static assets from
  FastAPI, one container.
- Deployed to the **kube-saturn** cluster via Flux; SQLite on a **PVC**
  (volsync-backed), media mounted **read-only** (NFS from Synology).
- Tooling: **uv** (Python), **pnpm** (frontend), **ruff** + **mypy** + **pytest**,
  **vitest** + **Playwright** (frontend).

```

**Where I/O happens.** Discovery is **stat-only** (no content reads); *all*
full-file reads — both blake3 hashing and ffmpeg decoding — run inside the worker
processes, so they're bounded by `max_scan_workers` (§3). The worker returns
`(content_hash, status, error_log, duration_ms)`; it takes only the path.

**Single DB thread (#4).** SQLModel is synchronous, so DB calls must never run on
the asyncio event loop. **All** DB access is serialized onto one dedicated thread
(a `max_workers=1` executor); each op opens a short session, commits, and returns
plain data (never a live ORM object across the boundary). This one thread *is* the
single writer, keeps the event loop unblocked, and — because it serializes — makes
`claim_next_pending` (SELECT-then-UPDATE-to-`scanning`) atomic for free, so two
concurrent pipelines can't claim the same task. Read latency serializes behind
writes too, which is fine at homelab scale. Worker processes never touch SQLite —
they are pure functions returning results, sidestepping multi-process contention.

---

## 6. Job Queue & Concurrency Model

**The database is the queue.** A **single, global, deduplicated scan queue**
(`scan_tasks`) holds durable per-file work items shared across all runs; it
survives restarts.

### Runs are concurrent; file processing is a single shared queue (Q2)
Multiple `job_runs` may be **active at once** — a run is a *logical grouping* of
the files a job cares about, not an exclusive owner of the workers. All runs feed
one global queue, and workers drain it in **queue (FIFO) order**, interleaving
files from different runs. Throughput is still bounded by `max_scan_workers` (the
NFS-bandwidth throttle), so concurrency improves *responsiveness* (an ad-hoc run
starts immediately) without adding NFS thrash.

**Path deduplication.** A `scan_task` is unique by `path` while active
(`pending`/`scanning`). When a run's discovery needs to scan a path:
- if an active task for that path already exists → the run **subscribes** to it
  (`scan_task_subscribers`) instead of enqueuing a duplicate;
- otherwise it creates the task and subscribes.

The file is decoded **once**; on completion the outcome fans out to **every**
subscribed run (stats, detections, SSE), and is written once to `scan_results` /
`files`. This is dedup at the *processing* layer — content-addressed caching (§3)
still covers the already-scanned case; this covers the concurrent-pending case
two overlapping jobs would otherwise double-scan.

Only **active** (`pending`/`scanning`) tasks are dedup targets; a `done` task is
never reused — a later run instead takes the §3 cache path. And a task is dropped
only when it has **zero subscribers**; since only *cancelled* runs unsubscribe, no
still-active run can reference a dropped task. A permanent failure (`unreadable`)
fans out like any terminal outcome, so every non-cancelled run's `run_files`
reaches a terminal `outcome` and **finalization always progresses** (no orphaned
run waiting on a vanished task).

### Lifecycle of a run
1. **Trigger** — scheduler (cron) or manual (`POST /api/jobs/:slug/run`) resolves the
   job from the YAML registry and creates a `job_run` (snapshotting the job def).
2. **Discovery** — resolve the source to a file list (walk dir, or query arr +
   apply path mappings); apply §3 **stat-only** pre-checks. Stability/TTL skips are
   recorded against the run immediately; every other file is enqueued/subscribed on
   the shared queue (the worker later hashes it and does the content-cache check).
3. **Drain** — the dispatcher pulls the next `pending` task by `seq`, submits it to
   the pool (bounded in-flight); the worker hashes → cache-checks → decodes.
4. **Collect & fan-out** — on completion, write `scan_results`/`files` once,
   `reconcile_detections`, enqueue replacements, and credit **all** subscribed runs.
5. **Finalize** — a run completes when every file it referenced is terminal
   (skipped, or its shared task `done`/`unreadable`); aggregate stats, fire events.

### Concurrency knobs
- Global `max_scan_workers` (default **3**) and optional per-job override — the
  single NFS-bandwidth throttle across *all* concurrent runs. Deliberately low.
- Hashing and decoding run in separate **worker processes** (`pebble.ProcessPool`),
  giving true parallelism (separate processes, so no shared GIL at all).

### Timeouts & cancellation (#3)
- Every scan runs with a **per-file timeout** (`max_scan_seconds`, default 1800).
  `pebble` terminates the worker process on expiry; the task is recorded as a
  transient `timeout` (retryable per the §3 policy), so one pathological file can
  never wedge a worker indefinitely.
- `POST /api/runs/:id/cancel` sets the run `cancelling` and **unsubscribes** it
  from the shared queue. A pending/in-flight task is only stopped when it has **no
  remaining subscribers** — then `pebble` terminates the worker process (which
  stock `ProcessPoolExecutor` cannot) and the task is dropped. Tasks another active
  run still needs keep running. The run is then marked `cancelled`.

### Scheduling & misfires (#14)
- APScheduler runs each job with `coalesce=True` and `max_instances=1`, so a job
  can never overlap itself and a burst of missed triggers collapses to one run.
- `misfire_grace_time` is configurable (default 3600s). If a job's previous run is
  still active when its next trigger fires, the trigger is **skipped with a logged
  notice** rather than queued.

### Crash recovery / idempotent resume
- On startup: reset any `scanning` task → `pending` (re-drained in `seq` order);
  `running` runs simply resume against the shared queue via their existing
  subscriptions. Already-`done` tasks and cached results (§3) make re-processing a
  cheap skip. No duplication, no lost progress, no lost run/file associations.

---

## 7. FFmpeg Integrity Checking

Two interchangeable backends, validated to agree against a shared corrupted-media
fixture set (`backend/tests/test_integrity.py`). Implemented in
`backend/scanrr/scanning/integrity.py`.

**Primary — PyAV (in-process libav bindings):** open with aggressive error
detection, demux and decode every frame of every stream, and capture libav's
**ERROR-level log stream** — not just exceptions. This last point is the whole
game and was proven necessary by the M1 spike:

- libav *conceals* most decode errors (bad macroblocks, damaged GOPs, premature
  EOF) and returns the frame **successfully** — reporting the problem only via
  `av_log`. A loop that only catches `av.FFmpegError` reports these files `ok`
  (verified false negative on a truncated file). So we must read the log stream.
- Capture it through **Python's stdlib `logging`** (PyAV forwards libav logs to
  the `libav` logger), *not* `av.logging.Capture()`: `Capture()` is thread-local
  and misses errors emitted from libav's **decoder worker threads**. A stdlib
  logging handler on the `libav` logger is thread-safe and catches them.
- Disable `AV_LOG_SKIP_REPEATED` (`av.logging.set_skip_repeated(False)`): libav
  suppresses identical consecutive messages, so in a **reused worker process** a
  second file emitting the same error string would be misclassified `ok`.
- Constraint: the libav logger is process-global → one file decoded per process
  at a time (matches the worker-pool model, §6).

**Statuses:** `ok` (decoded clean), `corrupt` (opened + decoded but ERROR logs),
`error` (couldn't open/demux — mangled header, not media).

**Reference — subprocess** (config `detector_backend: pyav | subprocess`):
`ffmpeg -v error -err_detect aggressive -i <file> -map 0 -f null -`. Classify by
**exit code** (robust where stderr string-matching is not): `rc != 0` → `error`;
`rc == 0` + stderr → `corrupt`; `rc == 0` + empty → `ok`. `-map 0` decodes every
stream for parity with PyAV's `demux()`.

**Spike result:** both backends agree on the pass/fail verdict for clean,
bit-flipped, truncated, and header-corrupted samples. **[OPEN]** which is primary
in prod — decide on throughput once we benchmark on real 4K remuxes over NFS; the
subprocess contract is simpler, PyAV avoids a fork per file.

**Discovery filter:** configurable media extensions
(`.mkv .mp4 .avi .m4v .ts .mov .wmv .flv .webm .mpg .mpeg .m2ts` …) and a minimum
file size, to skip samples/artwork/subtitles.

## 8. Database Schema

SQLite, WAL mode, `busy_timeout=5000`, foreign keys on. DDL is indicative; Alembic
owns the canonical migrations.

**Conventions.** All timestamps are `TEXT` in **ISO-8601 UTC** (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`).
**Retention:** `scan_results` is the durable content cache — intentionally permanent
(one row per distinct content ever seen). `done` `scan_tasks` are *eligible* for
pruning once all subscribing runs have finalized (the per-run record lives on in
`run_files`) — a background prune is **planned but not yet implemented**, so done
tasks are currently retained (harmless: dedup only targets *active* tasks).
`notification_queue` rows are deleted after a successful flush (M5).

## 9. Sonarr / Radarr Integration

Arr instances are defined in the YAML config (§0), referenced by an arr job's
`arr_instance: <name>`. Enumeration is **async httpx**, done in the orchestrator
(off the DB thread) before the run's discovery.

### Discovery (arr-type jobs)
- **Sonarr** (API v3): enumerate `GET /api/v3/series` → per series
  `GET /api/v3/episodefile?seriesId=…`; collect `episodeFile.path`, `episodeFileId`,
  episode id. **Radarr:** `GET /api/v3/movie` → `movieFile.path`, `movieFileId`,
  movie id.
- **Path mapping:** arr returns paths in *its* namespace. Apply the longest-prefix
  match from the **instance's `mappings`** (from the YAML) to translate to scanrr's
  local mount, then scan as usual. Record the arr linkage in `file_arr_links`
  (keyed by instance **name**) so remediation is possible.
- Files that don't match any mapping (or aren't present on the mount) are flagged as
  discovery warnings, not scanned.

### Auto-replacement (destructive — opt-in per job)
When a corrupt detection has an arr link and the job has `auto_replace`, the run
**finishes scanning first**, then proposes replacements:

1. **Propose & gate (Q3).** For each corrupt arr-linked file, create a
   `replacement` in `pending_approval` capturing the intended delete + search, and
   enqueue a `replacement_pending_approval` notification (§10). By **default**
   (the YAML job's `auto_approve` unset), the run completes and the UI shows
   *"N files will be deleted & re-requested"* for the user to **approve or reject**
   (individually or as a batch). If the job sets `auto_approve: true` (explicit
   opt-out), rows are auto-approved (`approved_by = 'auto'`) and proceed immediately.
   A **per-run deletion cap** (`max_deletions_per_run`,
   default 25) aborts and raises `needs_attention` if a single run would delete more
   than the cap — a guard against a path-mapping mistake, especially when approval
   is bypassed.
2. **Delete** (only after approval): Sonarr `DELETE /api/v3/episodefile/:id`,
   Radarr `DELETE /api/v3/moviefile/:id`.
3. **Search:** `POST /api/v3/command` (`EpisodeSearch` / `MoviesSearch`).
   Fire `replacement_requested`, set `requested_at`.
4. **Bounded polling (Q4).** A poller checks arr `history`/`queue` for that media
   id every `replacement_poll_interval` (default 120s), advancing `searching` →
   `grabbed` → `imported`, up to `replacement_search_timeout` (default 12h). On
   timeout with no grab → `failed`, detection `needs_attention`, notify
   ("no release found"). Self-contained — needs no arr-side webhook config.
   (Webhook-driven confirmation is a possible future optimisation.)
5. **Verify (#6):** on import, **re-scan the file at its path** (decode it directly).
   - clean → `succeeded`, resolve the detection, fire `replacement_completed`.
   - still corrupt → if `attempt < max_replace_attempts` (default 2) start the next
     attempt at step 2; otherwise `exhausted`, detection `needs_attention`.
     Closes the loop; prevents an endless delete → grab-bad-release → delete cycle.

**Safety:** `auto_replace` defaults **off** (a YAML job option). Approval is required
by default; `auto_approve: true` is an explicit per-job opt-out. Deletions are
irreversible, so the UI shows a clear warning, the deletion cap bounds blast radius,
and every action is audited in `replacements`.

**Implementation (M5).** A periodic `ReplacementExecutor` (interval
`replacement_poll_interval`) reconciles: it executes **approved** replacements
(delete + search → `requested`, at most `max_deletions_per_run` per tick), then
polls **requested** ones via the arr history (`imported()`), verifying on import and
timing out at `replacement_search_timeout`. Arr calls (`delete_file`, `search`,
`imported`) are async httpx against the YAML instance; DB writes go through the DB
thread. Manual `POST /detections/:id/replace` proposes a `pending_approval` row;
approval flips it to `approved` for the executor to pick up.

---

## 10. Notifications (Pushover)

Events: `scan_started`, `scan_completed` (with summary counts),
`corrupt_found`, `replacement_pending_approval`, `replacement_requested`,
`replacement_completed`, `job_failed`.

**Config in the YAML (§0).** The `pushover:` stanza holds `user_key`, `api_token`,
and an optional `events:` allow-list (omit = all). No `notification_channels`/`rules`
tables — like arr, notifications are configuration, not DB data. No `pushover:`
stanza → notifications are disabled (the queue still drains, sending nothing).

**Queue + periodic flush (Q5).** Events do **not** send inline. Producers
`enqueue_notification` into `notification_queue` (dedup by `dedup_key`); the
`NotificationFlusher` runs every `notification_flush_interval` (default 300s) and
drains, grouped by `event_type`:
- fewer than `notification_batch_threshold` (default 5) → send **individually**;
- otherwise **one batched digest** ("47 corrupt files found") — no push-storm on a
  big first scan, respecting Pushover rate limits.

Sends never block scanning; transient failures are recorded in `notification_log`
(status `failed`) and don't stall the queue. Events not in the `events:` allow-list
are drained without sending. The Pushover client is behind a thin interface so more
backends (ntfy, Discord, …) can be added later.

## 11. REST API & Realtime

Base: `/api`. JSON throughout.

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/jobs` | List jobs (from the YAML registry — **read-only**) |
| POST | `/jobs/:slug/run` | Trigger a run of a YAML job by slug |
| GET | `/runs` · `/runs/:id` | Run history / detail + stats |
| POST | `/runs/:id/cancel` | Cancel a running job |
| GET | `/runs/:id/files` | This run's per-file ledger (`run_files`: disposition + outcome), paged |
| GET | `/detections` | Corrupt files (filter by status) |
| POST | `/detections/:id/replace` | Manually propose a replacement (→ `pending_approval`) |
| POST | `/detections/:id/acknowledge` · `/ignore` · `/resolve` | Triage transitions |
| GET | `/replacements` | List replacements (filter by status, e.g. `pending_approval`) |
| POST | `/replacements/:id/approve` · `/reject` | Approve/reject a proposed deletion (Q3) |
| POST | `/replacements/approve` | Bulk-approve all `pending_approval` |
| GET | `/arr-instances` | List arr instances (from YAML — **read-only**, no api_key) |
| POST | `/arr-instances/:name/test` | Connection test (by name) |
| GET | `/settings` | Effective runtime config (DEFAULTS + YAML `settings:`) |
| GET | `/notifications` | Notification send log (`notification_log`) |
| POST | `/library/revalidate` | Re-scan against current detector (scope-previewed, rate-limited) (#7) |
| GET | `/stats` | Dashboard aggregates |
| GET | `/activity` | Live feed: running jobs (progress + ETA from `run_files`) and files decoding now (per-file `pct` from `scan_progress`) |
| GET | `/events` | **SSE** stream: run progress, task updates, new detections |
| GET | `/metrics` | Prometheus metrics (§14a) |
| GET | `/health` | Liveness/readiness |

**Auth (#9):** all **mutating** routes (POST/PUT/DELETE — especially the
destructive `/detections/:id/replace` and replacement approvals) require a shared
secret (`X-Scanrr-Token`, from an env/k8s Secret), enforced by middleware. GET
routes and `/health`/`/metrics` are open behind Cloudflare Zero Trust. This is
defense-in-depth against other in-cluster callers, not a user-auth system.

**Realtime:** clients subscribe to `/api/events` (SSE). The orchestrator publishes
`run.progress`, `task.updated`, `detection.created`, `run.completed` events; the UI
updates live without polling. TanStack Query caches are invalidated on relevant events.

## 12. UI Views & Routes

Modern, dark-mode-first, shadcn/ui components. Left nav + content.

| Route | View | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | **Dashboard** | Active runs (live progress bars), library health donut (ok/corrupt/unreadable), recent runs, open-detection count, scan-throughput chart. |
| `/jobs` | **Jobs** | **Read-only** table of YAML jobs (schedule, last run, Run-now) + a **"Generate job YAML"** helper that emits a config stanza to paste into the ConfigMap (no insert). |
| `/runs/:id` | **Run detail** | Live phase indicator, aggregate stats, streaming per-file table (path · disposition/status · outcome · duration), cancel. |
| `/detections` | **Corrupt files** | The triage list: path, detected date, run, status; expandable ffmpeg error log; actions: replace, acknowledge, ignore, resolve. Bulk actions. |
| `/replacements` | **Replacements** | Proposed deletions awaiting **approval** (approve/reject, per-item or batch), plus in-flight/verifying/exhausted history. (M5) |
| `/integrations` | **Integrations** | **Read-only** view of the YAML Sonarr/Radarr instances + their path mappings, with a connection **Test** button per instance. |
| `/settings` | **Settings** | Read-only effective runtime config (DEFAULTS + YAML `settings:`). |

Design touches: live-updating progress via SSE, optimistic triage actions, empty
states, toast on notifications, colour-coded status badges (green ok / amber
unreadable / red corrupt).

---

## 13. Configuration & Settings

Layered: **env vars** (`SCANRR_*`: `database_url`, `config_file`,
`api_token` — the mutating-route shared secret, `log_level`) → **YAML `settings:`**
(§0) → code **`DEFAULTS`**. Effective config = `DEFAULTS` overlaid with the YAML
`settings:` stanza. **This section is the canonical list of tunables and their
defaults** (values echoed in other sections' comments are illustrative):
`max_scan_workers`, `hash_algorithm`, `detector_backend`, `media_extensions`,
`min_file_size_bytes`, `min_file_age_seconds` (stability gate, default 120),
`max_scan_seconds` (per-file timeout, default 1800),
`scan_max_attempts` (transient-failure retries, default 3),
`misfire_grace_time` (default 3600).
Replacement: `max_replace_attempts` (default 2), `max_deletions_per_run`
(default 25), `replacement_poll_interval` (default 120s),
`replacement_search_timeout` (default 12h).
Notifications: `notification_flush_interval` (default 300s),
`notification_batch_threshold` (default 5).

## 14. Security & Safety

- **Secrets in the mounted config:** arr API keys and Pushover tokens live in the
  YAML config file (§0). In the homelab it is **rendered by an ExternalSecret**: the
  jobs/settings/mappings are literal in the template (versioned in git), while the
  secret values are pulled per-field from 1Password, producing a Kubernetes **Secret**
  mounted read-only at `/config/scanrr.yaml`. Because k8s handles encryption-at-rest
  and RBAC, there is **no app-level encryption**. The API never returns `api_key`.
- **Media mounts read-only** — scanrr never writes to the library. The only writes
  to arr-managed files are explicit `auto_replace` deletions via the arr API.
- **Destructive ops gated:** `auto_replace` off by default; deletions require
  **human approval** by default (bypass is an explicit per-job opt-in), bounded by a
  per-run deletion cap and per-detection attempt cap, with a full audit trail in
  `replacements`.
- **In-cluster authz (#9):** mutating API routes require the `X-Scanrr-Token`
  shared secret (§11), so a compromised/rogue pod can't trigger arr deletions even
  inside the cluster edge.
- **Deployment:** behind Cloudflare Zero Trust (owner-only) like the rest of the
  homelab; no built-in *user* auth in v1. Add a Zero Trust entry per the kube-saturn
  CLAUDE.md workflow when deploying.

---

## 14a. Observability (#15)

- **Structured logs (JSON):** every per-file decision is logged with its reason —
  `scanned` (with verdict + duration), `skipped` (with `disposition`), `retry`,
  `unreadable`, `timeout` — so "why did/didn't this file get scanned?" is
  answerable after the fact without re-deriving it from the DB.
- **`/metrics` (Prometheus):** counters (`files_scanned_total`,
  `corrupt_found_total`, `replacements_total`, `scan_errors_total`), a scan-duration
  histogram, and gauges for queue depth and active workers. Scrapeable by the
  homelab Prometheus for dashboards/alerts.
- **`notification_log`** remains the audit trail for outbound events.

---

## 15. Deployment

- Multi-stage Dockerfile (pnpm build frontend → copy into Python image → uvicorn).
- k8s (kube-saturn / Flux): Deployment + Service + PVC (SQLite, volsync-backed) +
  read-only NFS media mounts + Cloudflare tunnel ingress + Zero Trust policy.
  ffmpeg/libav provided by the base image (PyAV wheels bundle libav, or install ffmpeg).
- Single replica (SQLite writer + in-process scheduler are not HA); liveness/readiness
  on `/api/health`.

## 17. Open Questions

_All resolved for v1 — kept as a decision log._

1. ~~blake3 vs sha256 default hash.~~ **blake3** (configurable to sha256).
2. ~~Concurrent runs vs global serialize.~~ **Concurrent runs over one global,
   path-deduplicated FIFO queue** (§6).
3. ~~Auto-replace safety on first enable.~~ **Human approval required by default**;
   a YAML job's `auto_approve: true` opt-out; per-run deletion cap (§9).
4. ~~Confirm replacement via polling vs fire-and-forget.~~ **Bounded polling** of arr
   history with a give-up timeout (§9).
5. ~~Per-file vs batched corrupt notifications.~~ **Queued + periodic flush**;
   individual under `notification_batch_threshold`, else batched digest (§10).

Remaining `[OPEN]` in-line: primary detector backend in prod (§7) — pending an
NFS throughput benchmark.

## 18. Milestones

- **M1 — Core scan engine:** SQLite schema, path jobs, blake3 + PyAV integrity,
  content-addressed idempotency, manual run, minimal run/detection API. CLI-testable.
- **M2 — Scheduling & queue:** APScheduler, durable `scan_tasks` queue, worker pool,
  crash recovery, TTL fast-path.
- **M3 — UI:** dashboard, jobs, run detail (live SSE), detections triage, settings.
- **M4 — Arr integration:** discovery + path mapping, `file_arr_links`, manual replace.
- **M5 — Auto-replace & notifications:** opt-in re-request lifecycle, Pushover events.
- **M6 — Deploy:** Docker image, kube-saturn manifests, Zero Trust, volsync PVC.
